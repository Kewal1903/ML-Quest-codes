# ML-Quest-codes
The codes made by me for the ML Quest hackathon, for the problem statement - "Identifying fake job listings", where my best approach resulted in 99.95% accuracy and my team ended up coming 3rd out of over 140 participating teams. The hackathon was organized by IEEE at GHRCE, Nagpur.
THe problem statement was solved using 3 approaches, each of them were prediction models using different classifiers - logistic regression, random forest classifier, and a neural network.
